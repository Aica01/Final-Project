# Ethical Hacking Technical Report

## Client: WordPress

## Date: May 11, 2024

## Prepared by: Jessica P. Mataya

## Executive Summary : 

This report summarizes the results of an ethical hacking assessment conducted for WordPress. The goal was to scan the organization's network architecture, applications, and systems for vulnerabilities. Using a variety of testing approaches, including penetration testing and vulnerability scanning, the evaluation revealed important and high-risk concerns. This detailed paper outlines these results and provides specific solutions for correction. By addressing these vulnerabilities proactively, WordPress may improve its cybersecurity posture and resistance to prospective threats.

# Vulnerability Summary:


 1. **Network Infrastructure:**
  - Identified vulnerabilities in network devices such as routers switches, and firewalls, including misconfigurations and outdated firmware.
 2. **Web Applications:**
 - Discovered vulnerabilities in web applications, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and insecure direct object references (IDOR).
 3.  **Operating Systems:** 			
 - Uncovered vulnerabilities in operating systems, including missing security patches, weak password policies, and unnecessary services running on servers.	
4.  **Wireless Networks:**
  - Identified weaknesses in wireless network configurations, such as the use of outdated encryption protocols, weak passwords for Wi-Fi access points, and lack of network segmentation.
5.  **Social Engineering:**
- Identified vulnerabilities related to social engineering attacks, such as phishing emails, pretexting phone calls, and physical security breaches.
6. **Database Injection**: 
- WordPress is vulnerable to database injection attacks due to improper sanitization of user inputs, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the database or data manipulation.
7. **File Inclusion Vulnerability**: 
- Certain plugins or themes in WordPress may have file inclusion vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to include and execute malicious files on the server.
8. **Session Fixation**: 
- WordPress may be susceptible to session fixation attacks, where an attacker can hijack a user's session by fixing or manipulating their session ID.
9. **Directory Traversal**: 
-  WordPress may allow directory traversal attacks, where attackers can navigate through directory structures to access sensitive files or directories outside the intended scope.
10. **Brute Force Login Attacks**: 
- WordPress login pages are vulnerable to brute force attacks, where attackers attempt to guess usernames and passwords repeatedly until successful authentication, leading to unauthorized access.
11. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**:
-  WordPress sites may be vulnerable to CSRF attacks, where authenticated users are tricked into executing unintended actions (e.g., changing settings or making purchases) without their knowledge.
12. **Information Disclosure**: 
- WordPress may disclose sensitive information in error messages or server headers, providing attackers with valuable insights into the server configuration or potential vulnerabilities.
13. **Insecure File Uploads**:
-  WordPress may allow insecure file uploads, enabling attackers to upload and execute malicious files (e.g., PHP scripts) on the server, leading to remote code execution.
14. **Insufficient Logging and Monitoring**: 
- WordPress sites may lack proper logging and monitoring mechanisms, making it difficult to detect and respond to security incidents in a timely manner.
15. **XML-RPC Vulnerabilities**: 
- WordPress's XML-RPC functionality may be exploited by attackers to perform various attacks, such as brute force attacks, denial of service (DoS), or remote code execution.

## Recommendation 

1. **Network Infrastructure:**
- Implement regular security audits and updates for network devices.
- Enforce strict access controls and implement intrusion detection systems.
2. **Web Applications:**
- Conduct regular security assessments and code reviews for web applications.
- Implement input validation and parameterized queries to mitigate SQL injection attacks.
3. **Operating Systems:**
- Implement a patch management process to ensure timely installation of security updates.
- Enforce strong password policies and implement multi-factor authentication for privileged accounts.  
4. **Wireless Networks:**
- Upgrade wireless encryption protocols to WPA3 and enforce strong, unique passwords for Wi-Fi 		access points.
- Implement network segmentation to isolate sensitive systems from the rest of the network.
6. **Social Engineering:**
- Provide regular security awareness training for employees to recognize and report social engineering attacks.
- Implement strict access controls for physical premises and sensitive information.
6. **Database Hardening**:
- Implement parameterized queries and proper input validation to prevent database injection attacks.
- Regularly audit and update database access controls to restrict unauthorized access.
7. **Plugin and Theme Security**:
- Regularly update plugins and themes to patch known vulnerabilities.
- Only install plugins and themes from trusted sources and remove any unused or outdated ones.
8. **Session Management**:
- Implement session expiration policies and regenerate session IDs upon login to mitigate session fixation attacks.
- Utilize secure cookies and implement measures to detect and prevent session hijacking.
9. **Directory Traversal Prevention**:
- Implement strict file system permissions and input validation to prevent directory traversal attacks.
- Utilize web application firewalls (WAFs) or security plugins to block malicious requests.
10. **Login Protection**:
- Implement rate limiting and CAPTCHA mechanisms to prevent brute force login attacks.
- Consider implementing two-factor authentication (2FA) for enhanced security.
11. **CSRF Protection**:
- Implement CSRF tokens and anti-CSRF measures to protect against CSRF attacks.
- Validate and sanitize user input before processing requests to prevent unauthorized actions.
12. **Error Handling and Information Disclosure**:
- Configure WordPress to display generic error messages to users and log detailed error information for administrators.
- Minimize the amount of sensitive information disclosed in error messages and server headers.
13. **File Upload Security**:
- Restrict file upload permissions to specific directories and file types.
- Implement file type validation and scan uploaded files for malware before allowing them to execute.
14. **Logging and Monitoring**:
- Implement robust logging and monitoring solutions to track and analyze system and user activity.
- Set up alerts for suspicious activities and regularly review logs for signs of unauthorized access or malicious behavior.
15. **XML-RPC Hardening**:
- Disable XML-RPC if not required or limit access to trusted IP addresses.
- Regularly monitor and update WordPress to patch any XML-RPC-related vulnerabilities.

# **Conclusion:**
Our investigation of WordPress's digital ecosystem revealed weaknesses that might jeopardize its stakeholders' confidence and security. Beyond basic identification, our goal was to preserve the integrity of interactions with WordPress's systems, as well as to ensure data and privacy. As cybersecurity evolves, implementing the guidelines given in this paper becomes critical. WordPress may negotiate the ever-changing world with resilience and emerge stronger by prioritizing security measures, cultivating a vigilant culture, and investing in effective defenses. Cybersecurity is more than a duty; it is a journey to a safer, more secure digital future.
